# Brain Organoid Computing: Future Directions and Applications

## Overview


This project explores the potential of using brain organoids for computing tasks. Brain organoids are three-dimensional structures grown from stem cells that replicate many features of the human brain. By leveraging the biological intelligence of brain organoids, we aim to perform various computational tasks such as generative tasks, recognition tasks, and robot control.

The process of creating brain organoids involves several steps:
1. **Skin Cell**: The process begins with skin cells.
2. **iPS Cell**: Skin cells are reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells.
3. **Brain Organoid**: iPS cells are then differentiated into brain organoids.

This project will apply this brain organoid for a variety of computer tasks!



## Potential Applications

1. **Parallel Computing Server & Cloud Computing**: Utilizing brain organoids for large-scale parallel computing and cloud services.
2. **AI Programming (Cloud, OSS)**: Developing AI programs that leverage the unique capabilities of brain organoids.
3. **Brain USB (I/O for Brain)**: Creating interfaces that allow direct input and output with brain organoids.
4. **Beating Psychological Diseases**: Using brain organoids to understand and develop treatments for psychological diseases.
5. **Complete AI Tasks**: Achieving advanced AI tasks, potentially leading to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI).
